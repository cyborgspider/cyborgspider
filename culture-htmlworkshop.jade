    h1 HTML5 Workshop
    p I love teaching and mentoring others, and this workshop was an opportunity to enrich the skillsets of several peers.
      |Broken up into three parts (HTML, CSS, and jQuery), this workshop was geared to people new to coding and who wished to
      |add value to the company by expanding their knowledge. I had example files and simple to follow instructions so that
      |people can learn on at their pace, and to inspire them to learn more. I look forward to holding more workshops (with different or advanced topics) in the future!
