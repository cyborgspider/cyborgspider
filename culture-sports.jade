    p For the past three years, I've organized intramural company sporting events. Sometimes we have awesome prizes, sometimes we do it for
      |the love of the sport. Basketball, table tennis, foosball; you get to see who's REALLY competitive among your peers! Whether it be setting
      |the teams and schedules, creating team logos, getting the word out through email or CEO presentations, the only thing that I enjoy doing more
      |than playing is setting the whole thing up!
