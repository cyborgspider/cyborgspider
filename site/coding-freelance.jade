    p From corporate websites, restaurant social networks, to my own personal side projects, I enjoy
      |practicing my craft outside the office walls. I'm constantly trying to provide extra value to my clients,
      |such as delivering best-practices documentation and initiating post-launch project maintenance training sessions.
      |I love to frequent industry meet-ups and events, and am always looking for ways to contribute to the community and my profession.
