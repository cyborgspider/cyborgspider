            |My name is Carlos Ortega, and I currently live and work in Los Angeles, CA. I grew up with drawing NBA team logos and making my own
            |personal comic books, so it's only natural that I ended up in a creative career. I'm seeking an environment of learning, collaboration,
            |mentoring and passion, a place where my contributions can enhance the experience of clients and colleagues alike!
